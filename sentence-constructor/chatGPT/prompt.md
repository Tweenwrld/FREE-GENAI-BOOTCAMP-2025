        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible sentence structure:

        [Subject] + [Location] + [Existence] + [Question] + [Action] + [Object] + [Location]

        Now, let's focus on the vocabulary. Here's a table to help you:

        |   Japanese	|   Romaji	        |   English
        |               |   kuma	        |   bear
        |               |   tobira	        |   door
        |               |   iru	to be, to exist
        |               |   gomi	        |   garbage
        |               |   suteru	        |   to throw away
        |               |   tsukau	        |   to use (polite form: tsukaimasu) "you" can be replaced with anata in informal form, but in polite form we use anata wa or anata ga but we omit them most of the time

        Using these vocabulary words, can you try to create a sentence in Japanese? Remember to think about the correct particles, conjugations, and word order!
