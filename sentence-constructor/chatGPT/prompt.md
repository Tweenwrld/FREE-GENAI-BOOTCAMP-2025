### Clues and Considerations
- try and provide non-nestedd bulletedd list
- talk about the vocabulary leaving out Japanese words as students can refer to the vocabulary table

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?         
    </user:input>
    <score>3.5</score>
    <score_reasons>
        - No japanese characters in the voc table
        - Unecessary beginning sentence, show the required answers from the start
        - Provision of polite form of verbs, students should figure them out
    </score_reasons>

        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible sentence structure:

        [Subject] + [Location] + [Existence] + [Question] + [Action] + [Object] + [Location]

        Now, let's focus on the vocabulary. Here's a table to help you:

        |   Japanese	|   Romaji	        |   English
        |               |   kuma	        |   bear
        |               |   tobira	        |   door
        |               |   iru	to be, to exist
        |               |   gomi	        |   garbage
        |               |   suteru	        |   to throw away
        |               |   tsukau	        |   to use (polite form: tsukaimasu) "you" can be replaced with anata in informal form, but in polite form we use anata wa or anata ga but we omit them most of the time

        Using these vocabulary words, can you try to create a sentence in Japanese? Remember to think about the correct particles, conjugations, and word order!
